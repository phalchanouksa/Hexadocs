# Paragraph

Paragraphs are where the magic happens—think of them as your content’s storytelling mode. A new paragraph is as easy as dropping an empty line.

```html
<p>
  This is a fire paragraph that breaks down a concept in detail. Keep it snappy
  and full of drip.
</p>
<p>This is another paragraph because one is never enough.</p>
```
