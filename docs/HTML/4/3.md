# Typography Formatting

Let's learn how to make our text look exactly how we want it

## Bold vs Strong

These might look the same, but they serve different purposes:

```html
<b>This makes text bold (just visual)</b>
<strong>This text is important!</strong>
```

:::tip Remember
Think of `<strong>` as your "Hey, pay attention!" text
Think of `<b>` as your "This just needs to be bold" text
:::

## Italic vs Emphasis

Another pair that looks similar but means different things:

```html
<i>This text is italic (like movie titles)</i>
<em>This text is emphasized (like stressing words)</em>
```

## Code Elements

Three helpful ways to show computer-related text:

```html
<!-- For showing code -->
<code>console.log("Hello!");</code>

<!-- For keyboard commands -->
<kbd>Ctrl + S</kbd>

<!-- For computer output -->
<samp>Success: File saved!</samp>
```

## Pre-formatted Text

Need to keep your spaces and line breaks? `<pre>` is your friend:

```html
<pre>
  This    text
    keeps  its
      spacing!
</pre>
```

## Text Decorations

```html
<mark>Highlight important stuff</mark>
<del>Old information</del>
<ins>New information</ins>
<small>Small print</small>
```

## Try It Yourself!

<LiveCodeBlock initialHTML={`

<div>
    <h3>Text Formatting Examples</h3>
    
    <p>This is <b>bold</b> and this is <strong>important!</strong></p>
    
    <p>Here's some <i>italic text</i> and some <em>emphasized text</em></p>
    
    <p>Save your work with <kbd>Ctrl + S</kbd></p>
    
    <p>Computer says: <samp>Hello World!</samp></p>
    
    <p>Here's some code: <code>let name = "Student";</code></p>
    
    <p><mark>Don't forget this part!</mark></p>
    
    <p><del>Version 1.0</del> <ins>Version 2.0</ins></p>
</div>
`}/>

:::tip Helpful Hint
When in doubt, use semantic elements (`<strong>`, `<em>`) for meaning, accessibility, screen reader and style elements (`<b>`, `<i>`) for appearance only!
:::

## Common Use Cases

- `<strong>`: Warnings, important instructions, keywords
- `<em>`: Words that change sentence meaning when emphasized
- `<i>`: Scientific names, technical terms, foreign phrases
- `<b>`: Keywords, product names (without special importance)
- `<mark>`: Relevant text in search results, highlighting syntax
- `<small>`: Disclaimers, copyright notices, side comments
